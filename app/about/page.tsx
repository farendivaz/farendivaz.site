          Hey! I&apos;m Fariz. I go by the name of Farendivaz in the online
          community.
        </p>
        <p className="border-b border-zinc-500">
          I&apos;m currently an undergraduate student majoring in Informatics
          Engineering in Indonesia. I focus on learning web development,
          especially frontend with React and Next.js
        </p>
        <p>
          I started learning web development in early 2022 as part of my
          coursework at university. It all started when one of my classes
          introduced me to HTML and CSS, and I immediately developed a strong
          curiosity for them. I found myself thoroughly enjoying the process of
          delving deeper into the world of web development, and my passion for
          it only grew stronger with time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Frontend development offers an extensive array of concepts and
          technologies to master, and I&apos;m fueled by my motivation to absorb
          as much knowledge as possible. I find great joy in learning something
          new and receiving feedback that helps me grow and enhance my skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through this website, I intend to share my projects and write
          informative blogs. I strongly believe that documenting what I&apos;ve
          learned is an effective way to solidify my understanding, while also
          allowing me to share my knowledge with others. Please don&apos;t
          hesitate to reach out to me if you need any assistanceâ€”I&apos;ll be
          more than happy to help
